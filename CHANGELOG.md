## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-03

The audit release. Fixes a secret leak, removes two Build 41 leftovers that were
being written to Build 42 servers, and derives `Map=` deterministically.

### Security

- **Secrets no longer reach the Nix store.** A secret in `settings` produced a
  `pkgs.writeText` base `.ini` at mode `444`, world-readable, containing values
  in cleartext — greppable out of `/nix/store` by any local user.
  `RCONPassword`, `DiscordToken` and `WebhookAddress` were all affected.
  - New `secretFiles` option (`Key = path`), with `passwordFile` as sugar for
    `Password`. Values are read at start and written straight into the key.
  - Evaluation now **fails** if a known-secret key appears in `settings`,
    `sandbox`, or a modpack's `defaultSettings` / `defaultSandbox`.
  - The renderer filters those keys independently, so a bare module import cannot
    leak one either.
  - `merge_ini.py` gained `--secret-file Key=path`; `--password-file` is gone
    with a pointed error.
- `extraArgs` is documented as the same trap in a different place: it is baked
  into a world-readable unit file.

### Fixed

- **`Whitelist=` and `Users=` are not Build 42 ini keys.** They were being written
  unconditionally, producing a config that listed admins and a whitelist and did
  nothing. Now gated behind `compatibility.build41`, default `false`. The
  whitelist on Build 42 is a table in `Zomboid/db/<servername>.db`.
- **`SpawnPoint = 2` removed from `survival-hard`.** `SpawnPoint` is a world
  coordinate triple (`x,y,z`), so this meant *two metres from the origin*.
- **Generated files were created read-only.** `cp` of a mode-444 store file gives
  the destination the source's permissions, so the *second* start failed with
  `cp: cannot create regular file: Permission denied`. Masked in production
  because PZ rewrites `SandboxVars.lua` in between. Now `install -m 0644`.
- **Two optional arguments reached `merge_ini.py` as a single empty string.**
  `${v+$v}` expands whenever `v` is merely set (and `v=""` is set), and
  `"${v:+$v}"` passes one empty argument because a quoted expansion is always one
  word that never disappears. Both aborted the start with `arg '' has no '='`.
  Correct form: `${v:+"$v"}`.
- **Two Lua syntax errors in the spawn renderers**, both invisible to `grep`:
  missing commas between table entries, and `"farm worker" = {` (Lua reads the
  string as a positional value, then finds `=`). Keys are now emitted bare when
  valid identifiers — matching PZ's own output — and bracket-quoted otherwise.
- **`nix flake check --all-systems` failed.** `aarch64-linux` was declared in
  `systems`, but PZ is a Steamworks title with no ARM build, so
  `packages.aarch64-linux.…` could not evaluate. Outputs are now `x86_64-linux`
  only; an ARM host may still consume the module.

### Added

- **Derived `Map=`, deterministically.** `Map=` is the one setting that cannot be
  written down statically — a map exists only if an installed mod ships
  `media/maps/<name>/`, and installed mods are unknown until steamcmd has run. So
  `map = null` now means *derive it*, at start, via `scripts/pz_maps.py`.
  - Sort key is **total**: `(priority, kind, numeric id, mod id, map name)`, with
    `baseMap` always last. Nothing depends on filesystem iteration order.
  - Duplicate map names are **reported** rather than resolved silently by
    download order. PZ resolves `media/maps/<name>` across every loaded mod, so
    two mods shipping one name previously loaded the wrong tiles with no warning.
  - New `mapOrder.{enable,priority,strict,dedupe}`; a mod shadowing the base
    map's name is an error.
  - New `baseMap` option, and `pz-maps` app / `--list-maps` for inspection.
- **Spawn points and regions.** `spawn.points` and `spawn.regions` render
  `<server>_spawnpoints.lua` and `<server>_spawnregions.lua` — two of the four
  files PZ lists as necessary for a server to work. Written only when non-empty,
  and removed when emptied, since PZ regenerates them when absent.
- **Admin accounts.** `adminAccount.{username,passwordFile}` passes the
  `-adminusername`/`-adminpassword` pair, which is the only way to create a Build
  42 admin. The `ps` exposure is inherent to PZ and documented rather than
  glossed.
- New options: `adminAccount`, `extraArgs`, `betaBranch`, `upnp` (now `false`),
  `selfManagedMods` (now `true`), `softReset`, `compatibility.build41`.
- New runner flags: `--secret`, `--map`, `--base-map`, `--map-priority`,
  `--strict-maps`, `--dedupe-maps`, `--list-maps`, `--extra-arg`, `--admin-user`,
  `--admin-pass-file`, `--soft-reset`.
- New checks: `secrets-not-in-store`, `spawn-and-reset`, `map-ordering`,
  `map-pin-clean`, `secret-guard`.
- `versions.json` gained `defaultBaseMap`, and `defaultRconPort` moved
  27015 → **27016** (27015 is Minecraft's). Read by the flake so the package, the
  runner and the module cannot drift apart.

### Changed

- `selfManagedMods` defaults to `true`. With it off, a player who opens the
  server's mod screen can write a different `Mods=` back to the `.ini`, and the
  next start would faithfully apply their change over yours.
- `upnp` defaults to `false`, unlike PZ's `true`. Automatic port forwarding
  punches holes in a firewall you deliberately kept closed, and cannot work
  behind a container at all.
- README substantially rewritten; a `docs/` set added (see below).
